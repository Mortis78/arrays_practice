# so far?
[I thought arrays is something your boss gave you...$who knew :) ]
I felt pretty good so far, it took me a bit to get the bools to work the way i wanted but that was do to over complication on my part.
## additional learning?
i just need to spend more time working with them, but i have a feeling there will be lots of that.
### questions
non yet, but we are about to do the group learning so im sure after that ill have plenty.
